Created a new project to test DevOps 
Need to provide some policy permissions before able to create DevOps project
To create devops project need a topic, that too needs its own set of permissions

Moved the project to a new compartment

I have created a user oci-dev but that user couldn't see the compartment the devops project was to be in 
In the end created a policy based on the hierarchy concept so that the user can see the compartment

Created the project,created a topic before that
created a cope repo enmpty one ( need to figure out how to link the repo to a server and then push that local repo to OCI)

created a VM instance so that I can push any code to that VM and have it accessible by the public 

Worked in the VM instance
created a local user arvind
was unable to ssh to the server using the local instance 

eventually figured out to edit the ssh_config file, adding these values

        PasswordAuthentication yes
        ChallengeResponseAuthentication no
        PubkeyAuthentication no

But it was more tricky than initially assumed, had to try multiple times to figure out how to login to the server as a local user
eventually after many attempts I commented out a few lines  within 

reference like this didn't really helped much https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/addingusers.htm
however, I figured out with help from googled articles to comment out certain lines and restart ssh , voila now I can login to the server using password and no longer need ssh key 

TBC,
figure out a way to link repo in local server to OCI, then try to figure out a way to build a pipeline that pushes the code to the server

Additional interets that peaked is using Terraform also to configure the devops project/ the resources needed in the compartment


--------------------------------------------------

Created a new free dns name and associated it with the always free LB supporting two webservers.
arvind.sytes.net

Need to create or design a better website then think of linking it with a DB possibly another OCI always free DB service.
